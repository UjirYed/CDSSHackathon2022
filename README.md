# ColumbiaHackathon
A short project exposing the soft pity system that Genshin Impact doesn't want you to know about.

All of our important results are contained within TheGenshinAverageProbability.py file.

We also include files in the Supplementary Analysis folder which is not relevant to our main results, and did not yield any interesting results.
